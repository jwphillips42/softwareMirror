softwareMirror
==============

A software mirror that lets the user play with contrast and color through through 
a webcam attached to the computer.

The program itself is very simple, but also rather fun to play with. Move the mouse left
and right along the screen to change the black/white threshold, and press the space bar
to switch which color the mirror can display (None -> Red -> Green -> Blue -> None).

Also, you can press p to save a copy of the current image.
